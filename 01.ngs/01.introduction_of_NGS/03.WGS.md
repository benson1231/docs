# 🧬 Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)

Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) is a comprehensive high-throughput sequencing approach that determines the complete DNA sequence of an organism’s genome. By interrogating the entire genomic landscape, WGS enables unbiased detection of genetic variation across coding and non-coding regions, making it a foundational technology in genomics, precision medicine, evolutionary biology, and population genetics.

WGS can detect a broad spectrum of genomic variants, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions and deletions (INDELs), structural variants (SVs), and copy number variations (CNVs). It is applicable to a wide range of organisms, including humans, animals, plants, and microorganisms.

## 1. Experimental Workflow of WGS

### 1.1 Sample Collection and DNA Extraction

* Extraction of high-quality genomic DNA from blood, tissue, cultured cells, or environmental samples
* Assessment of DNA integrity, purity, and concentration

### 1.2 Library Preparation

* Fragmentation of genomic DNA using enzymatic or mechanical methods (e.g., sonication)
* End repair, adapter ligation, and index incorporation
* Size selection to achieve desired insert length

### 1.3 Sequencing

* Short-read sequencing using **Illumina** platforms for high accuracy
* Long-read sequencing using **PacBio** or **Oxford Nanopore Technologies** for improved resolution of repetitive regions and structural variants
* Generation of raw sequencing data in **FASTQ** format

## 2. Bioinformatics Analysis Pipeline

WGS data analysis converts raw sequencing reads into high-confidence variant calls through a series of standardized computational steps.

### 2.1 Quality Control and Preprocessing

* Evaluation of read quality, GC content, and contamination (FastQC)
* Aggregated quality reporting across samples (MultiQC)
* Adapter removal and quality trimming (Trimmomatic, fastp)

### 2.2 Read Alignment

* Alignment of reads to a reference genome using:

  * **BWA-MEM** or **Bowtie2** for short-read data
  * **Minimap2** for long-read data
* Generation of sorted and indexed BAM files

### 2.3 Post-alignment Processing

* Marking or removal of PCR duplicates (Picard, Samtools)
* Base quality score recalibration (BQSR) when applicable

### 2.4 Variant Detection

* **SNV and INDEL calling**: GATK HaplotypeCaller, FreeBayes
* **Structural variant detection**: DELLY, Manta
* **Copy number variation analysis**: CNVnator, Control-FREEC

### 2.5 Variant Annotation and Filtering

* Functional annotation of variants using **ANNOVAR** or **Ensembl VEP**
* Clinical interpretation using curated databases (ClinVar, gnomAD)
* Filtering based on quality metrics, population frequency, and predicted impact

## 3. Applications of WGS

* Identification of pathogenic variants in rare and inherited diseases
* Comprehensive mutation profiling in cancer genomics
* Microbial genome characterization and antimicrobial resistance analysis
* Crop and livestock improvement through genome-wide variant discovery
* Population genomics and reconstruction of evolutionary history

## 4. Strengths and Limitations

### Strengths

* Unbiased, genome-wide variant detection
* High sensitivity for diverse variant types
* Applicable to both reference-based analysis and de novo genome assembly

### Limitations

* Large data volumes requiring substantial storage and computational resources
* Higher cost compared with targeted sequencing approaches
* Complexity in variant interpretation, particularly in non-coding regions

WGS provides the highest-resolution view of the genome and serves as a cornerstone technology for modern genomics research. When integrated with robust bioinformatics pipelines and clinical or functional annotation frameworks, WGS enables deep insights into genetic architecture, disease mechanisms, and evolutionary processes.
