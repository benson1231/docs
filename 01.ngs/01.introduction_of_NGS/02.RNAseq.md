# 🧬 RNA Sequencing (RNA-seq)

*20251217*

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a high-throughput transcriptomic technology based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) that enables comprehensive profiling of RNA molecules within a biological sample. RNA-seq allows both quantitative and qualitative interrogation of the transcriptome, including gene expression levels, alternative splicing, transcript isoforms, gene fusions, and diverse classes of non-coding RNAs. It has become a core methodology in functional genomics, systems biology, and translational biomedical research.

Compared with hybridization-based platforms such as microarrays, RNA-seq provides superior dynamic range, nucleotide-level resolution, and the ability to detect previously unannotated transcripts, making it the current gold standard for transcriptome analysis.

## 1. Experimental Workflow of RNA-seq

### 1.1 RNA Extraction and Library Preparation

* Isolation of high-quality total RNA from cells or tissues
* Evaluation of RNA quantity and integrity (e.g., RIN or DV200)
* RNA enrichment strategies:

  * **Poly(A) selection** for mRNA-focused profiling
  * **rRNA depletion** for total RNA and non-coding RNA analysis
* Reverse transcription of RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA)
* Fragmentation, adapter ligation, and incorporation of sample-specific indices

### 1.2 Sequencing

* Sequencing is most commonly performed on **Illumina platforms**
* Paired-end sequencing (e.g., 2 × 100 bp or 2 × 150 bp) is widely adopted
* Sequencing output is generated in **FASTQ** format containing read sequences and quality scores

## 2. Bioinformatics Analysis Pipeline

RNA-seq analysis transforms raw sequencing reads into biologically interpretable measurements through a multi-step computational workflow.

### 2.1 Quality Control and Preprocessing

* Assessment of raw read quality using **FastQC**
* Aggregation of quality metrics across samples with **MultiQC**
* Removal of adapter sequences and low-quality bases (e.g., Cutadapt, Trimmomatic, fastp)

### 2.2 Read Alignment or Mapping

Two primary strategies are used for RNA-seq read mapping:

* **Genome alignment**

  * Splice-aware aligners such as **STAR** and **HISAT2**
  * Enables detection of exon–intron boundaries and novel splice junctions

* **Transcriptome-based mapping (pseudo-alignment)**

  * Lightweight approaches such as **Salmon** and **Kallisto**
  * Provides rapid and computationally efficient transcript quantification

### 2.3 Expression Quantification

* **Gene-level quantification**:

  * featureCounts
  * HTSeq-count
* **Transcript-level quantification**:

  * Salmon
  * Kallisto

Quantification outputs may be expressed as raw counts, TPM, or FPKM, depending on downstream analytical requirements.

## 3. Expression Units and Normalization

RNA-seq expression values can be represented using multiple normalization schemes, each designed for a specific purpose. Correct usage of these metrics is critical for valid biological interpretation.

### 3.1 Expression Units (Library-size / Length–based Normalization)

| Metric                            | Description                                                                                              | Accounted factors             | Typical use                                                                                            | **Not** recommended for                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CPM** (Counts Per Million)      | Raw gene counts scaled by the total number of mapped reads per sample                                    | Sequencing depth              | Between-sample comparison of the same gene across biological replicates; quality control and filtering | Within-sample gene comparisons; differential expression (DE) analysis |
| **TPM** (Transcripts Per Million) | Gene counts normalized by transcript length (kb) and scaled per million mapped reads                     | Sequencing depth, gene length | Within-sample gene expression comparison; cross-sample visualization within the same condition         | DE analysis                                                           |
| **RPKM / FPKM**                   | Length-normalized read counts scaled by library size; similar to TPM but calculated in a different order | Sequencing depth, gene length | Comparison of expression levels between genes within a single sample                                   | Between-sample comparisons; DE analysis                               |

### 3.2 Differential Expression–oriented Normalization

| Method                        | Description                                                                                               | Accounted factors                                              | **Recommended** use                                                                    |

| **DESeq2 (median of ratios)** | Estimates sample-specific size factors using the median ratio of gene counts relative to a geometric mean | Sequencing depth, RNA composition                              | Between-sample normalization for DE analysis using raw counts |
| **edgeR (TMM)**               | Uses a trimmed mean of log expression ratios between samples to estimate normalization factors            | Sequencing depth, RNA composition (robust to composition bias) | Between-sample normalization for DE analysis using raw counts |

## 4. Differential Expression Analysis

Differential expression (DE) analysis aims to identify genes whose expression levels differ significantly between experimental conditions.

* **DESeq2**

  * Negative binomial modeling of count data
  * Shrinkage estimation for dispersion and fold change

* **edgeR**

  * Negative binomial framework with empirical Bayes dispersion estimation
  * Highly flexible for complex experimental designs

* **limma-voom**

  * Linear modeling with precision weights derived from count data
  * Efficient for large sample cohorts

Robust DE analysis requires appropriate normalization, adequate biological replication, and careful control of multiple testing.

## 5. Functional Interpretation

Downstream analyses are performed to translate DE results into biological insights:

* Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis
* Pathway analysis (KEGG, Reactome)
* Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
* Commonly used tools include:

  * clusterProfiler
  * fgsea
  * DAVID
