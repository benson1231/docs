## training-repo

These repositories were created as learning resources during my training. They compile practice projects and documentation based on publicly available articles, online tutorials, open-source examples, and course materials, which I reorganized, adapted, or expanded for educational purposes. All content is derived from public sources or represents secondary creative work for study and practice. If you have any questions regarding the materials, their usage, or licensing considerations, please feel free to [contact me](https://github.com/benson1231).
