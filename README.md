This [e-book](https://benson1231.gitbook.io/benson1231-docs) documents my ongoing journey in **bioinformatics engineering**, integrating knowledge across **data science, software development, and biomedical research**. The goal is to systematically curate this learning process and build a set of **searchable, reusable knowledge resources**.
For the full catalog, please refer to the [📚 Table of Contents](catalog.md).
