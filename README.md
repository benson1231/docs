📌 This [e-book](https://benson1231.gitbook.io/benson1231-docs) documents my ongoing journey in **bioinformatics engineering**, integrating concepts from **data science, software development, and biomedical research**. Its aim is to systematically curate this learning process and develop a collection of **searchable and reusable knowledge resources**.

For a complete overview, see the [📚 Table of Contents](./catalog.md).
